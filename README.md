# Morph Developer Console

MDC was the original Morph Developer GUI. This is intended to be the rebirth of MDC with the following improvements:

- Now an Electron app
- Documentation
- Modern tooling
- Much better use of TypeScript
- Better code quality
- Better performance

## Install

It is recommended to use Yarn with Electron projects. You will need to explicitly set `cafile`, `cert` and `key` config values using `yarn config set`. Once yarn has these config values you can install using the following:

`yarn --registry https://npm.morph.int.tools.bbc.co.uk install`

## Development Issues

Documentation of issues encountered during development.

### NPM Invalid Config Warning

NPM throws an invalid config warning because the morph-cli depends on a (very old) local version of npm:

`npm WARN invalid config loglevel="notice"`

This can be fixed by upgrading morph-cli to use a later version, or by removing the local version from the tree. A script to perform the latter has been included in the package.json.
