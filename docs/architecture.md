# Architecture

This application is comprised of the following root directory structure:

```
.vscode/
build/
bundle/
dist/
docs/
scripts/
src/
static/
test/
types/
...configuration files
```

#### .vscode/

A configuration directory for the VSCode editor.

#### build/

Assets for `electron-builder` to be used in creating packages for different OS targets.

#### bundle/

This directory is (re)created at build time - all bundled files and everything the app needs to run ends up in here.

#### dist/

This directory is (re)created at build time - all fully built packages for publishing end up in here.

#### docs/

The home for documentation pages such as this one.

#### scripts/

Scripts for build, release, publish.

#### src/

All files that comprise the application source. The source is split up into the following:

`common/` - files to be shared across main / renderer processes or which are used by multiple features
`css/` - all functionality for building stylesheets and accessing dynamic styles
`features/` - Redux slices and React components associated with them
`main/` - Electron application logic for the main process
`renderer/` - Electron application logic for the renderer process
`index.ejs` - Root HTML template

#### static/

Static files such as images.

#### test/

Contains [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) unit / component integration tests and [WDIO](https://webdriver.io) end to end tests.

#### types/

The rest of the things in the root directory are configuration files for ESLint, Git, Prettier, StyleLint, Vitest, PNPM, PostCSS, TailwindCSS, Electron Builder and TypeScript.
